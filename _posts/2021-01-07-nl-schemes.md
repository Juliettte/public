In this page are gathered several integration strategies guaranteeing energy identity at the discrete level, in order to solve weakly nonlinear partial differential equations involved in piano modeling. First, are mentionned two contributions adapted to wave propagation in the piano string under large deformations, leading to a model with nonlinear potential energy. Moreover is mentionned a contribution tailored to wave propagation in the rotating hammer neck, leading to a model with additional non-linear kinetic energy.
