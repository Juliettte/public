In this page are gathered several integration strategies guaranteeing energy identity at the discrete level, in order to solve weakly nonlinear partial differential equations involved in piano modeling. Two contributions are adapted to wave propagation in the piano string under large deformations, leading to a model with nonlinear potential energy. Moreover a contribution is tailored to wave propagation in the rotating hammer neck, leading to a model with additional non-linear kinetic energy.
