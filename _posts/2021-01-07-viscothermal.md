I co-advised the PhD of Alexis Thibault with Thomas HÃ©lie and Henri Boutin around viscothermal effects in wind instruments. One highlight of the thesis was to review the reduced model including those effects used in musical acoustics, and contribute with new models of porosity, roughness and viscothermal effects in conical instruments.
