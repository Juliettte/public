The publications listed here are devoted to high order time discretizations of linear wave equations. We have proposed
  * Fourth order $(\theta,\varphi)$-schemes, that guarantee the preservation of a discrete energy identity,
  * the Space-time convergence proof of polynomial-based schemes, including the usual $theta$-scheme, but also the new fourth order $(\theta,\varphi)$-schemes, and also stabilized schemes,
  * High order schemes for dissipative equations that guarantee the preservation of a discrete energy identity.
