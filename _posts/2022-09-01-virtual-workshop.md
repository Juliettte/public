The software openwind allows the computation of the acoustic response of a wind musical instrument in the harmonic and temporal regimes, as well as the sound synthesis of several types of wind instruments. The [webpage](http://openwind.inria.fr) lists all the possible ways of using openwind:
* online with the [graphical demo interface](http://demo-openwind.inria.fr)
* offline by installing the python package 
* offline by installing directly the [sources](https://gitlab.inria.fr/openwind/openwind/-/releases) 
The [documentation](https://files.inria.fr/openwind/docs/) allows to install the software, begin to use it easily thanks to tutorials, learn to use advanced features thanks to the "how to", and provides a deep documentation of the code structure.
