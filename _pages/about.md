I am a researcher in [Modartt](http://www.modartt.com) company, where I help develop new algorithms for real time sound synthesis of musical instruments.

I am on leave from a researcher position in the Inria team [Makutu](https://team.inria.fr/makutu/). My research focused until december 2023 on numerical aspects of wave propagation, more specifically applied to musical instruments. This axis of the team was located in Talence, France.

I am a member of the [SCRIME](https://scrime.u-bordeaux.fr) where scientists can meet composers and musicians to achieve joint projects.

<!--In the GDS [EcoInfo](https://ecoinfo.cnrs.fr), I try to better understand the environmental footprint of the digital world.-->

<!-- I also like to play the baroque oboe with the [Ensemble Les Précieuses](https://ensemblelesprecieuses.fr), the Ensemble Maddalena and others, to sing in the choir [Orfeo](https://ensembleorfeo.fr) and to listen to [J. S. Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) wonderful work.-->
