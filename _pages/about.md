I am a researcher in the Inria team [Makutu](https://team.inria.fr/makutu/). My research focuses on numerical aspects of wave propagation, more specifically applied to musical instruments. This axis of the team is located in Talence, France.

I am a member of the [SCRIME](https://scrime.u-bordeaux.fr) where scientists can meet composers and musicians to achieve joint projects.

As a member of [Modartt](http://www.modartt.com) company, I help develop new instruments for real time synthesis.
